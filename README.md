# govbot

A discord bot for collective decision making, with the goal of being both *effective*, and *aligned*.

Some principles it follows:

*aligned*

- Decisions aren't enacted without the approval and input of the community they impact.

*effective*

- Decisions pull in the expertise of the community and relevant subject-matter-experts.

It is primarily for the Mina protocol community, but is intended to eventually be possible to deploy for other communities too.

See documentation on the plan for this [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aNGYqRoUVXtOw8aef9mSQHHSIvG2thnrxMw7FCB_AhM/edit).
